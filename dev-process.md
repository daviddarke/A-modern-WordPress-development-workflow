# [fit] What's wrong with this simple setup?

* It's almost impossible for two developer to work at the same time, (unless they are sat next to each other)
* Dropbox does have a revision system, but only on a per file basis
* Deployments were cumbersome and not traceable (FTP is the worst)
* No real control over servers and hosting (Shared hosting)
* Nothing was re-usable
* Hours wasted handling development environment differences and thing out of our control

### Laravel Homestead

> **Laravel Homestead is an official, pre-packaged Vagrant box that provides you a wonderful development environment without requiring you to install PHP, a web server, and any other server software on your local machine.**
-- Homestead documentation

^ Vagrant boxes are completely disposable. If something goes wrong, you can destroy and re-create the box in minutes!

### 'Please use git' - A blog by Amin Shah Gilani [^1]

* It’s too complicated
* I’m not too good with the command line.
* “Our project is too small”
* “Our team is too small”
* “We use Dropbox”

# Recap 2

#ASTODO Only show database part

![inline](assets/anatomy_of_wordpress.pdf)

---

## We started using shared remote databases
##  **mysql.mycompany.co.uk**

This means all our **development** databases are accessible from anywhere.

---

# Recap 3

#ASTODO only show uploads

![inline](assets/anatomy_of_wordpress.pdf)

---

## We store development asset on Amazon S3

An S3 bucket per site, which is only accessible to the development team

# Recap 4

#ASTODO Only show WordPress parts

![inline](assets/composer.pdf)

Composer pulls which even WordPress version is required (usually the latest) and all required plugins.
# [fit] https://www.atomicsmash.co.uk/blog/using-composer-wordpress-development/


---

![inline](assets/repo-files.png)

Git repository is clean of WordPress, plugins and uploads


---

# Premium plugins

We use an private composer storage solution called Release Belt.

# Capistrano

![inline](assets/capistrano.pdf)

---

## A single deployment

1. **Developer** runs `cap production deploy`
1. **Capistrano** logs into your remote server
1. **Capistrano** grabs the latest code from Git
1. **Capistrano** runs composer and pulls down WordPress
1. If there are no errors in setup, **Capistrano** puts changes live

---

## `cap production deploy`
## `cap uat deploy`
## `cap staging deploy`

---

## `cap production deploy:rollback`

# Forge...

1. Creates the server on Digital Ocean

1. Helps automate Let's Encrypt SSLs
1. Provides an interface for creating 'sites'
1. Provides an interface for creating databases
1. Patches the servers for security updates (in the background)

### Think of your Wordpress website as a web application.

You shouldn't need live content to build / test a website

---

# GDPR

If you are downloading content to a development machine from a live site, make sure you aren't pulling live user / customer data.
