### Working with WordPress

[.build-lists: true]
[.autoscale: true]

# [fit] What's wrong with this?

* It's almost impossible for two developer to work at the same time, (unless they are sat next to each other)
* Dropbox does have a revision system, but only on a per file basis
* Deployments were cumbersome and not traceable (FTP is the worst)
* No real control over servers and hosting (Shared hosting)
* Nothing was re-usable
* Hours wasted handling development environment differences and thing out of our control

---

## Our challenges

* Shared development environment (reproducible)
* Find a reliable deployment method
* Improve hosting reliability, level of control and performance

### Laravel Homestead

> **Laravel Homestead is an official, pre-packaged Vagrant box that provides you a wonderful development environment without requiring you to install PHP, a web server, and any other server software on your local machine.**
-- Homestead documentation

^ Vagrant boxes are completely disposable. If something goes wrong, you can destroy and re-create the box in minutes!

# Recap 3

#ASTODO Only show database part

![inline](assets/anatomy_of_wordpress.pdf)

---

## We started using shared remote databases
##  **mysql.mycompany.co.uk**

This means all our **development** databases are accessible from anywhere.

---

### Think of your Wordpress website as a web application.

You shouldn't need live content to build / test a website

---

# GDPR

If you are downloading content to a development machine from a live site, make sure you aren't pulling live user / customer data.

---

# Recap 2

#ASTODO make this the second version of the diagram

## We store development asset on Amazon S3

An S3 bucket per site, which is only accessible to the development team
