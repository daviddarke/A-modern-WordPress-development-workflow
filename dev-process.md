[.build-lists: true]

# [fit] What's wrong with this?

* Almost impossible for two developer to work at the same time, (unless they are sat next to each other)
* Dropbox does have a revision system, but only on a per file basis
* Deployments were cumbersome and not traceable
* No real control over servers and hosting
* Nothing was re-usable
* Hours wasted handling development environment differences

---

[.build-lists: true]

## X challenges

* Shared development environment
* Get a reliable deployment method
* Improve hosting

### Laravel Homestead

> **Laravel Homestead is an official, pre-packaged Vagrant box that provides you a wonderful development environment without requiring you to install PHP, a web server, and any other server software on your local machine.**

&

> **No more worrying about messing up your operating system! Vagrant boxes are completely disposable. If something goes wrong, you can destroy and re-create the box in minutes!**

# Recap 3

#ASTODO Only show database part

## We started using shared remote databases
##  **mysql.mycompany.co.uk**

This means all our **development** databases are accessible from anywhere.

### Think of your Wordpress website as a web application.

You shouldn't need live content to build / test a website

# GDPR

If you are downloading content to a development machine from a live site, make sure you aren't pulling live user / customer data.
